# Plotly_Challenge

Roza is studing bacterial species in the human navel to determine if she can find a bacterial strain that could potentially synthesize proteins to taste like beef. The data presented here is collected from the test human population and the charts below will show demographic information, the top 10 strains of bacteria in the test subjects, the subject's navel washing frequency and the bacteria cultures per sample.

For Deliverable #4, the three changes I made to the project were:
1. Adding a paragraph to explain to viewers the purpose of the website.
2. Adding background color to the jumbotron.
3. Changing the font color of the jumbotron.
